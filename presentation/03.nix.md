# What is Nix?

* A functional programming language and package manager.
* The output of a Nix program determines the packages and configurations.
* All dependencies are built and stored in the Nix store, and are then linked
  to be used in the currently-running system.
* Notably, every package uses its own set of dependencies, meaning that it is 
  impossible to end up in dependency hell.
* Example: Java 17 alongside JDTLS.

```nix
# Declare a function that accepts `config` and `packages` as parameters,
# and returns part of a system configuration. That configuration is merged with
# configs from other included files.
{ config, pkgs, ... }:
{
  # Set the system packages to include:
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    # Java Development Kit, v17
    jdk17
    # Java Language Server
    jdt-language-server
  ];
}
```
