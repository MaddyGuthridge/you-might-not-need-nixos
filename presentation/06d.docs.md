# Documentation hell

There is no single source of truth when figuring out how NixOS works.

* There are two wikis for some reason.
* Often you'll have to scour forum posts to find answers.
* And sometimes you'll be left reading source code in their enormous git repos.
* The moment you want to do anything non-trivial, you'll quickly run into
  issues and will be sent on a google hunt.
