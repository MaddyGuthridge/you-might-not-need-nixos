# What I hate about docker

* The config file is so imperative.
* Build times even slower than Nix.
* Container isolation is good for security, but there are many poor design 
  decisions that effectively negate this if you aren't careful.
* Hard to learn.
  * Need to learn both Docker and the underlying OS
* Comparatively slow to start and stop.
