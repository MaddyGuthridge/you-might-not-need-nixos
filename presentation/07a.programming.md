# What's it like for programming?

* It isn't possible to globally install multiple versions of a tool side-by-side. 
* For interpreted languages, everything except binary dependencies works fine.
* But otherwise, you'll often need to manually configure dev shells for your 
  projects.
* A dev shell is basically a Python virtual environment, for your whole OS.
* Dev shells work well once you set them up, but the setup process is 
  ***incredibly*** tedious.
* Check out this dev shell configuration I had to set up for the slideshow
  viewer I'm using in this presentation...
