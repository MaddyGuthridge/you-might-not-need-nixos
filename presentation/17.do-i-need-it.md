# Do I need NixOS?

* I want to love NixOS.
* It does so many things right.
* When it works, I am filled with joy.
* But then I'll update my system and it'll decide to compile chromium from 
  source.
* For the time being, I'm going to persist, but I will be keeping an eye out for
  alternatives.
* Now that my self-imposed challenge is over, I am not bound to my arbitrary 
  "all nixable things must be nixed" rules.
* As such, there is nothing stopping me from using a combination of tools.
* I cannot live without `mise` and its incredible ability to install development
  tools quickly and easily. The auto-activation of tools is the icing on the 
  cake.
* Thankfully, adding it to NixOS is a single line of configuration:

```nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ mise ];
```
