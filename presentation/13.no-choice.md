# There are literally NO OTHER OPTIONS!

* Or at least no good ones.
* `programs.nix-ld.enable = true;` is not great.
* Especially when I couldn't figure out how to install the libraries that 
  programs wanted.
* Basically to have pretty much any non-NixOS program in your Nix configuration,
  you'll have to nix it yourself.
* No wonder the package ecosystem for NixOS is so huge: there are basically no 
  options other than creating Nix packages for anything you want to be installed 
  declaratively, and at that point you may as well contribute the package 
  upstream.
