# There are literally NO OTHER OPTIONS!

* Or at least no good ones.
* Hypothetically, you can run arbitrary executables by setting 
  `programs.nix-ld.enable = true;`, which allows binaries to arbitrarily link to
  libraries and other dependencies.
* However, this didn't work for some programs, especially when I couldn't figure
  out how to install the libraries that programs wanted.
* Basically to have pretty much any non-nixed program in your Nix configuration,
  you'll have to nix it yourself.
* No wonder the package ecosystem for NixOS is so huge: there are basically no 
  options other than creating Nix packages for anything you want to be installed 
  declaratively, and at that point you may as well contribute the package 
  upstream.
