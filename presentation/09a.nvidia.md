# Wait I forgor GPU support

* No wonder my games were running so badly
* I was just about to enable all the features by hand, when I discovered that
  NixOS has a hardware configuration repository which has a complete
  configuration for my laptop, and all I need to do is import it! Incredible!
* All I had to do was add a couple of lines to my configuration:

```nix
{ config, pkgs, ... }:
{
  imports = [
    # Wait there is a pre-made hardware configuration specifically for my system
    # which will automatically set up my GPU and a bunch of other things?!
    "${
      builtins.fetchGit { url = "https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-hardware.git"; }
    }/dell/xps/15-9500/nvidia"
  ];
}
```
