# Flakes, attempt 2

* For my second attempt, I decided to keep my main configuration as a regular
  config, and just use flakes for other parts.
* For example, for COMP2511, I need Gradle 8.8, which is pretty old. Accessing
  that old version from NixOS's history is much easier when I put it in a flake
  so that it can have separate inputs and outputs.

```nix
{
  description = "Gradle 8.8";
  inputs = {
    # This particular commit has Gradle 8.8
    nixpkgs.url = "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/d9f258945d3532e399d7f73fcd9b6fa5b4393e01.tar.gz";
  };
  outputs =
    {
      self,
      nixpkgs,
      ...
    }:
    {
      packages.x86_64-linux.default = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.x86_64-linux.gradle_8;
    };
}
```
