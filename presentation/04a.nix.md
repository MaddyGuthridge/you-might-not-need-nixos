# What is Nix?

* A functional programming language and package manager.
* The output of a Nix program determines the packages and configurations.
* All dependencies are built and stored in the Nix store, 
* Active packages are linked to be used in the currently system.
* Notably, every package uses its own set of dependencies, meaning that it is
  impossible to end up in dependency hell.
* Example: Java 17 alongside JDTLS.

```nix
# Declare a function that accepts `config` and `packages` as parameters,
# and returns part of a system configuration. That configuration is merged with
# configs from other included files.
{ config, pkgs, ... }:
{
  # Set the system packages to include:
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    # Java Development Kit, v17
    jdk17
    # jdtls, which has its own copy of Java 21 in its part of the Nix store.
    # Not a conflict in sight!
    jdt-language-server
  ];
}
```
