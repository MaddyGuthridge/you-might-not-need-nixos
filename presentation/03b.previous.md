# My previous system

* Fedora Linux
* Package management:
    * DNF for system utils
    * Flatpak for non-system desktop apps
    * Snap when Flatpaks broke
    * Mise for developer tools (more on it later)
* Configured entirely imperatively.
* Simple, fast and reliable. Nothing important has ever broken for me on Fedora.
* Difficult to reproduce.
