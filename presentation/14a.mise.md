# Alternative: Mise en Place

Mise advertises itself as *"the front-end to your dev env"*

* Weak isolation based on a rust-backed script that modifies your `$PATH` 
  variable as you `cd` about your system.
* Feels like a hack, but works surprisingly well.
* What does Mise configuration look like?
