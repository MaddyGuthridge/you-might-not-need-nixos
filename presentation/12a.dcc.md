# How else are Flakes useful?

Let's flake-ify COMP1511's `dcc` compiler. It has some pretty tough
requirements:

* Many build dependencies (Python, Clang, GNU Make, and more)
* Some of these are also compiler runtime dependencies (Clang, GCC)
* We don't want to needlessly pollute our runtime environment with those
  dependencies, especially since the user may desire different versions.
* But we still need to provide some compiled-app runtime dependencies (GDB,
  Valgrind).
* Let's see how Nix flakes make this somewhat trivial
