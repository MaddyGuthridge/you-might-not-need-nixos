# Conclusion

There are no gods of purity watching over us, despite what the NixOS wiki may
have you believe. 

Do what makes you happy, and don't stress about making things perfect.

Perfection will not make you happy, but trying new things will, even if you
originally thought you didn't need them.

Who knows, maybe you might just prove yourself wrong.
