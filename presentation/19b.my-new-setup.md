# ¿Por Qué No Los Dos?

And so my plans for my system configuration are:

* NixOS for general system configuration and package management.
* Mise for management of developer tools, such as Gradle and Node.
* Docker for deploying my software on my server.
* For dotfiles management:
  * I am considering `home-manager` (a dotfile manager for NixOS), but did not 
    have time to experiment with it yet. I've heard it is pretty slow.
  * If that doesn't work, I'll have to keep looking. I haven't found anything
    ideal yet.
