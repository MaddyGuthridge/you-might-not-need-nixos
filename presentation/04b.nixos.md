# What is NixOS?

* Nix programming language for the entire operating system.
* Every package and all core system configurations are described in the Nix language.
* All system configuration (ideally) goes in your nix config.
* Atomic upgrades and easy roll-back if anything breaks!

```nix
# Additional file systems, such as my old Fedora install so I can grab files I
# forgot I needed

# Rename the computer
networking.hostName = "kronk";

# Set your time zone.
time.timeZone = "Australia/Sydney";

# Define a user account. Everything is set up here except for my password
