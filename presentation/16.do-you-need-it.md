# So, do you need NixOS?

Well, you might not... But also you might...

* If you just want easy setup of development tools, use Mise instead. It's way 
  nicer for development work.
* If you're running a server, just use Docker. Writing Dockerfiles is hard, but
  using other people's Docker containers is easy, and there is a massive 
  ecosystem for you to take advantage of.
* However, if you want to understand the state of your system without hunting 
  through random config files and running random commands, NixOS is incredible.
* While it didn't "just work", it worked more often than it didn't, and I was 
  able to configure some really advanced things which would be very painful on 
  other systems.
* I was much more impressed than I thought I would be.
