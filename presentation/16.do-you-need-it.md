# So, do you need NixOS?

Well, you might not... But also you might...

* If you just want easy setup of development tools, use Mise instead.
* If you're running a server, just use Docker.
  * Writing Dockerfiles is hard
  * Using other people's Dockerfiles is easy
  * Take advantage of the ecosystem
* However, if you want to understand the state of your system without hunting 
  through random config files and running random commands, ***NixOS is incredible***.
* While it didn't "just work", it worked more often than it didn't, and I was 
  able to configure some really advanced things which would be very painful on 
  other systems.
* I was much more impressed than I thought I would be.
