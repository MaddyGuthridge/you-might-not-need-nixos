# What NixOS does right

* An enthusiastic, helpful and kind community.
* A huge package ecosystem: it has basically everything.
* A huge amount of flexibility: when I ran into problems, working around them
  was always possible, even if it wasn't simple.
* It's declarative! I cannot stress enough how awesome this is!
