# And so I decided to switch to NixOS

* Wherever possible I tried to use the "NixOS way" of doing things. I
  intentionally avoided alternative tools when Nix claimed to be capable of
  solving those problems.
* I tried to use NixOS for everything. I kept Fedora installed just in case, but
  avoided booting into it.
* In particular, I used it for:
  * Tutoring work (tutorials, marking, etc)
  * Working on personal programming projects
  * Playing games
