# Alternative: Mise en Place

* Look how easy it is to install Gradle 8.8

  ```toml
  gradle = "8.8"
  ```

  That's 17 lines shorter, and I didn't need to find a random-ass commit hash to
  end up with the right version.

* Look how easy it is to install anything from NPM

  ```toml
  "npm:tsx" = "latest"
  ```

  This also works for packages written in Python, Ruby, Go, Rust, and more!

* What about installing a random binary from GitHub?

  ```toml
  "github:Slackadays/Clipboard" = "latest"
  ```
