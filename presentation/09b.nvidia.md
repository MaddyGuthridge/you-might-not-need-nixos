# Wait I forgor GPU support (contd.)

* And now any time I want to run a game with a GPU, I just need to modify the
  launch options for that game in Steam to `nvidia-offload %command%`.
* Why doesn't this work automatically? Who knows?
* I also couldn't figure out how to just make Steam run using my dedicated GPU
  entirely (eg by making `steam` actually run `nvidia-offload steam`).
* To be fair, I also couldn't get this to work on Fedora, so I won't judge too
  hard.
