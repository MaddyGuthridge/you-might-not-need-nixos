# What's it like for programming?

* Yeaaaahhhhhh......

That isn't all either! I needed to create a "wrapper package" because you can't
wrap a package that hasn't been Nixed unless you fork its source code.

```py
# src/sxp_wrapper/__init__.py
print("I need this to be here otherwise it fails to build")
```
