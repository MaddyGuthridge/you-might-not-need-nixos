# Alternative: Docker

* Isolation via lightweight virtual machines.
* Probably way higher reproducibility than Mise, and maybe even better than
  NixOS (at least without flakes). You are literally running the same virtual
  machine.
* All your VMs are isolated, which is good for security.
* You can use it to spin up development environments, and use things like VS
  Code's remote server tools to do your work within them.
* What does a dockerized program look like?
