# Watching compilers compile

* `nh`  provides a much better TUI for  troubleshooting the many issues you will
  encounter while rebuilding your system.
* In particular, it'll tell you what is taking so long to compile.
* Which begs the question: ***WHY IS THIS NOT THE DEFAULT?***
* Nix's default tooling has terrible user experience.
* Troubleshooting and debugging is much harder than it needs to be.
