# Watching compilers compile

* As a side note, the nix helper `nh` provides a much better TUI for 
  troubleshooting the many issues you will encounter while rebuilding your 
  system.
* In particular, it'll tell you what is taking so long to compile.
* Which begs the question: ***WHY IS THIS NOT THE DEFAULT?***
* Seriously, the user experience of using Nix's default tools is awful, and 
  makes so many troubleshooting steps needlessly difficult.
