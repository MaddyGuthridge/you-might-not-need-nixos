# How can NixOS succeed?

* Improved documentation. NixOS is currently in the wild west when it comes to
  documentation.
* Improved tooling, especially in terms of observability. Tools like `nh` are
  excellent, please make them the default.
* Better error messages when trying to run non-Nix software (let me know what
  libraries I need to install please).
* Less boilerplate when packaging software. `flake.nix` is ok, but could be much
  more concise.
