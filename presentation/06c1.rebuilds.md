# Modifying your system state

* Rebuilding is slow
* System updates often take well over 15 minutes on my machine.
* Updating to NixOS 25.11 took more than an hour, and consumed more than 55GB of
  data for some reason.
* Even when you make zero changes, rebuilds take about 20 seconds.
* Nix language editor support is subpar.
* Errors are only caught at build-time.
* I wish Nix was a statically-typed language.
