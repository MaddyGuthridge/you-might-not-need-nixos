# Modifying your system state

* Rebuilding is slow
* System updates often take well over 15 minutes on my machine.
* Updating to NixOS 25.11 took more than an hour, and consumed more than 55GB of
  data for some reason.
* Even when you make zero changes, rebuilds take about 20 seconds.
* This is especially annoying due to the subpar editor support for Nix, meaning 
  that most mistakes are only detected at build time, rather than as I type, 
  which really slows down the speed at which you can iterate.
* Wow I wish Nix was a statically-typed language so that the editor support 
  would be better.
