# What I dislike about Mise

* Not everything is handled by existing integrations.
* If the tool you want to install has complex dependencies that aren't handled
  already, you'll find yourself writing Lua.
* You'll need to create installation scripts that set up these dependencies
  manually.
* This is far worse than what it's like to solve similar problems with Nix.
