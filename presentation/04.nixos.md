# What is NixOS?

* What if we turned this into an entire operating system?
* Every package on the system and all core system configurations (users, file 
  system mounts, etc) are described in the Nix language.
* No more learning random commands or editing random files, you can set up 
  basically everything in a single configuration!
* Atomic upgrades and easy roll-back if anything breaks!

```nix
  # Additional file systems
  fileSystems."/media/yzma" = {
    device = "/dev/disk/by-uuid/26d0f537-4884-4344-bd85-04a20a610b41";
    fsType = "btrfs";
  };
  
  # Rename the computer
  networking.hostName = "kronk";
  
  # Set your time zone.
  time.timeZone = "Australia/Sydney";
  
  # Define a user account. Everything is set up here except for my password
  users.users.maddy = {
    isNormalUser = true;
    description = "Maddy Guthridge";
    extraGroups = [
      "networkmanager"
      "wheel"
    ];
  };
  
  # And more!
```
